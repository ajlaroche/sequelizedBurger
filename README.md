# sequelizedBurger
Full stack app to devour burgers of your choice with Sequelize

App where you can add your favorite burger and devour it.  

This is a simple full stack development demonstration that uses a mysql database to keep the status of the site persistent.

This application requires a local mysql database to run properly or you can run the production version on heroku, which can be found at https://ajl-sequelizedburger.herokuapp.com/.

Simply add the name of the customer eating the burger, click the devour button to change the status of the particular burger of your choice and move it to the Devoured Category.

You can also add a new burger by entering its name in the text area and clicking submit.
